## Introduction
The mental well-being of young adults is crucial in today's fast-paced world. This project aims to explore the mental health of students aged 16-24, focusing on age, course of study, year of study, and CGPA. Data collection through questionnaires is analyzed and presented in meaningful graphs and cross tabs.

## Target Group and Tools Used
- **Age group:** 16-24
- **Tools used:** Python, Excel

## Course Distribution
The data includes various courses of study among the students surveyed.

## Analysis of the Study
The study focuses on analyzing the relationship between different attributes and mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and panic attacks.

## Expected Outcomes
- Analyze the relationship between age and anxiety issues.
- Analyze how the course of study influences student depression levels.
- Determine how many students are seeking treatment for depression and anxiety.
